# Meatball-Munchers
Ben & Kyle

For this project we are modifying Kyleâ€™s previous unit 3 final project Meatball Munchers in order 
to provide it with increased complexity and purpose. The object of the game will be to consume as 
many fresh meatballs to achieve maximum size before losing to one of the many dangers that will be 
implemented in this iteration of the game such as the spiked meatballs or the raft below sinking. 
With regards to the theme, it's that gluttony does pay off. This is shown through the fact that 
after a certain amount of time, the raft below the player begins to slowly sink due to his large 
stature, ultimately ending the game and giving the player their high score. Our team decided to choose 
this specific project as we believe that it would be more enjoyable as a final project and during 
development if we can continue working on an already finished game. Using an already existing framework, 
we believe that we can further develop the game, utilizing our time to bring to life more complex ideas 
that we would have had to skip over due to time wasted on earlier and basic setup of the game loop and GUI.
